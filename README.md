GestureFlow
GestureFlow is a hand gesture detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with real-time detection capabilities. This project leverages tensorflow and keras for model training and tkinter for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The primary objective of GestureFlow is to detect and classify hand gestures from images and live video streams.

Features
Real-time Hand Gesture Detection: Detects hand gestures from live webcam feed.
Data Augmentation: Enhances model training by augmenting the training data with various transformations.
Customizable Threshold: Allows adjusting the detection threshold for better accuracy.
Simple GUI: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the detection results.
