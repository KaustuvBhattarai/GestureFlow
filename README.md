#GestureFlow
GestureFlow is a hand gesture detection and system input and navigation system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with real-time detection capabilities. This project leverages tensorflow and keras for model training and tkinter for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Development Log :

####July 21, 2024 - Update 1
-Real-time Hand Gesture Detection: Detects hand gestures from live webcam feed.
-Data Augmentation: Enhances model training by augmenting the training data with various transformations.
-Customizable Threshold: Allows adjusting the detection threshold for better accuracy.
-Simple GUI: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the detection results.
