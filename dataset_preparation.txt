Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To achieve optimal performance from the hand gesture detection model, it is essential to prepare the dataset following specific guidelines. 
This document provides detailed instructions on the types of images that should be included in the dataset, as well as recommendations for capturing high-quality hand gesture images.

- Image Specifications
Image Resolution: 64*64 is optimal but can use larger ones. 

- Image Format:
Ensure that all images have three color channels in RGB.

- Background and Lighting:
Try to use a plain, contrasting background to ensure the hand is clearly distinguishable.
Avoid cluttered or noisy backgrounds.
Ensure consistent lighting conditions to minimize shadows and highlights on the hands.

- Hand Position and Orientation:
Include images of hands in various positions and orientations.
Capture gestures from different angles to improve model robustness.
Ensure that hands are centered and occupy a significant portion of the image.

- Hand Variability:
Include images from different individuals to account for variability in hand shapes, sizes, and skin tones.
Incorporate images of both left and right hands, as well as various finger configurations.


- Data Augmentation
To improve the model's generalization ability, apply data augmentation techniques.

Note: After everything try splitting data into validation sets for finalization. A common practice is to allocate 80% of the images for training and 20% for validation. 
This split helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.
